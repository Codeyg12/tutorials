### Description

This project is to show off my current skills as a developer. The goal of this project is to use a test-file.txt and categorize, parse, and format the following files. customers.xml orders.json and products.csv. I decided to use Python as it seemed very fitting for this project, I had just recently learned about how reading and writing files worked. The steps I took were as follows

1. Categorize each record into the following 3 types, customer, product, or order
2. Take the now categorized information and parse it into the required format
3. Write the parsed information into the predesignated format
